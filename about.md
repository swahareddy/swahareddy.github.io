# Tejaswa Gavankar

Hi, I am Tejaswa Gavankar. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I work in the technology division of Credit Suisse, a major global financial firm. 

With regard to my professional skills, I would call myself an E-shaped technologist. I code in python, primarily for back end of big data and Google cloud.

I am good at exploring new technologies for greenfield projects and scaling them from PoC to production.

I love working with people as much as I love technology. I have played a significant part in Credit Suisse India's Branding and Collaboration workstreams. I have organised the firm's partnerships with major events like Pune Agile UnConference and Grace Hooper Celebration. I've also organised events that have reached over 5000 employees.

I'm always upto something fun outside work. Over the last year I have been seriously engaged with educational non-profits and I also do some other projects to stay sharp.
