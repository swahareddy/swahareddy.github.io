title: Iced ~Lattte~ Emails
---


You're probably emailing a busy person and its likely they'll quickly preview your email on their phone or laptop before deciding to "return to it later". They never return. Thus, value your email's subject and opening sentences. For instance don't start with "I hope you've been well".

# Glenn Kramon

Email writing rules from Glenn's class:
1. **Know something about the person to whom you’re writing, and exploit it.**

2. **Be who you are.** If you’re not, you’re fooling yourself as well as the recruiter. And you could end up in a job that makes you miserable.

3. **Begin with something she doesn’t know, not with something she does know.**

4. **Name someone you know whom the person you’re writing also knows (and respects).** “Heidi Roizen suggested I contact you.” (Or, have that someone introduce you two.)

5. **Try to compare yourself to the person you’re writing.** Example: “Like you, I decided my strength was in finance, not manufacturing...” Or mention something you’ve learned from that person.

6. **Can you tell a story you know will make that person smile, even laugh?** A huge “yes” here. Humor is one of the most effective communication tools in your arsenal.

7. **“Pick a lane.”** Instead of covering everything on your resume, give an example of your talent that shows how you can help that person and the organization – the more interesting, the better. Then, either in your signature line or the text, you can link to your CV or LinkedIn profile.

8. **Be confident but not arrogant. And sound humble.**

9. **Keep it short.** Make sure there’s an “ask” or next step. And keep the ask as small as possible. Make it easy to say yes.

10. **Offer something in return.** Maybe you know something, or someone, that she doesn’t.

11. **Check it for accuracy, then check it again**
