                        <h1 class="display-1">Options apart from an MBA</h1>
<p>There are many options depending on your background and goals, but these were what I considered:</p>

<h1 id="india">India</h1>

<h2 id="iims">IIMs</h2>

<p>I did appear for CAT twice. The first time I was not too prepared and scored a 99.01 percentile. The second time I was more prepared, but things went wrong in the exam centre and I ended up with a 98.65 percentile. I had admits from IIM Shillong and new IIMs, but chose not to join.</p>

<h2 id="isb">ISB</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re still in college, I strongly urge you to consider YLP. It offers a very good safety net and gives you freedom to aim higher and take more risks till the time you start your MBA. More than anything, I believe itâ€™s the least competitive of the 3 ways to get into ISB, a school that ranks alongside LKI for me.</p>

<p>I applied in the EEO during my second year after college with a 325 GRE. I was rejected without an interview.</p>

<p>By then the draw of ISB started fading for me. The absolute numbers are impressive, but the intake is also 2x of IIMs. In addition, placement numbers match IIM ABCâ€™s, but what people forget to acknowledge is that IIM is essentially freshers. ISB has &gt;4 years workex on average. So itâ€™s a comparison of apples and oranges. ISB also has a professional marketing team unlike IIMs that rest on their legacy.</p>

<h1 id="other-masters-abroad">Other Masterâ€™s Abroad</h1>
<h2 id="masters-in-computer-science">Masterâ€™s in Computer Science</h2>

<p>Of course, this option is only for someone who has studied something related in undergrad that lets them keep up with an MS CS.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d given my GRE in my final year of engineering with the intention of applying for MS like everyone around me. But a part of me knew I did not want to stay an SDE for long. After successful campus placements I decided to put the MS plans on hold.  Iâ€™m glad I took this decision because after about 4 years of working, I know that I want to explore a lot more breadth and not gin depth as a developer or a system architect.</p>

<p>But what is undeniable is the RoI of an MS CS degree. Itâ€™s much much better than an MBA. If you are really ambiguous about your aspiration, this is the best and safest option Why?</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can get in as a fresher.</li>
  <li>Reputation of school is not as important as in MBA. You stand truly on your individual hard work.</li>
  <li>If you take it seriously, you can secure a $100k+ salary ($130k is becoming common too from what I observe).</li>
</ul>

<p>So if youâ€™re 24, earning 130k at Amazon after your MS. By the time youâ€™re 28, youâ€™ll be earning 200k?
Compare that with an MBA applicant, who gets in at 26. Graduates at 28 with a $160k package (top consulting companies).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The salary is 20% for the MS graduate at the same age.</li>
  <li>MS graduate has earned $$$ for additional 4 years.</li>
  <li>MS student pays 1/3rd the fees of an MBA student.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if youâ€™re driven purely by money, and youâ€™re still early in your career, then MSÂ Â» MBA hands down.</p>

<h2 id="masters-in-management-mim">Masterâ€™s in management (MiM)</h2>

<p>This is another great option, especially in Europe. Unfortunately there is little awareness about this degree. Itâ€™s the learnings of an MBA for freshers. So you can similar roles and similar companies as an MBA, just one designation lower.</p>

<p>I would have done this right after college had I known about it then. By the time I did my research I was in my second year of work which would make me too old for many MiMs. Incase you are considering this, I collected comparative data that might be helpful: <link />.</p>

<p>So itâ€™s much easier to get into INSEAD or LBSâ€™s MiM program campared to their MBA programs. Honestly, the brand tag of a business school and an entry into the right kind of role is all you need even from an MBA. So this lets you punch above your weight and succeed.</p>
<h2 id="masters-in-engineering-management-mem">Masterâ€™s in Engineering management (MEM)</h2>
<p>While MiM is a European concept. The US does not have the same. 
But it does have an MeM (Masterâ€™s in engineering management), masterâ€™s in project management, and masterâ€™s in MIS (Management Information Systems). Not sure about the prospects of these.</p>
