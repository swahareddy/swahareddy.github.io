<p>The thing that I love about iTeach, apart from the students of course, is that I get to learn so much and try new things. <br>
iTeach’s core is educating students when RTE cannot support them (i.e. Grades 8-10). This is managed professionally by full-time teachers. <br></p>

<p>I volunteer with iTeach as a mentor to the older students who are now in Grades 11 and 12th (iTeach alumni, in what we call the CPLP program). This program is run by Tanvi, an amazing, enthusiastic teacher with iTeach. This program supports students in dreaming beyond what they or their families themselves thought was possible - from financially supporting admission to junior colleges, to extra coaching and summer programs.</p>

<p>The final (for now) leg of this support is admission to colleges. After a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/youths-in-need-enter-top-colleges-with-some-help/articleshow/79685996.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">successful pilot last year</a>, iTeach launched a full-scale program in 2021 to help students secure admission to the best colleges.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before I go ahead describing what we did. I’d like to remind us of the context in which this support is needed. These are students from low-income background. They are often children of watchmen, maids and auto drivers (as you’ll see in the stories below). Just to get them to graduate from junior college has often been a challenge for their families. Far from being able to afford fees for a degree, the students are now expected to start earning and helping out. Most of them have never stepped out of Pune and living in a hostel in a different city is an alien choice (watch 45sec of Prajakta’s story in the video below). They do not have professional role models like most of us do (think about your parents’ friends, neighbours, uncle etc that you might have admired). <br><br>
While they are certainly built to fly, their wings are clipped due to their circumstances.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>iTeach found out the top (liberal arts) colleges in India like Ashoka and Azim Premji University that offer need-based scholarships and had sessions with the students telling them what these colleges are about. The admissions to these colleges were a combination of entrance exams, essays and interviews. Mentors like me were assigned a group of students with whom we worked to develop their stories and essays that I’ll be sharing below. <br>
In addition I alone ran a month-long crash course for the mathematics section of the entrance exam getting arts and commerce students reacquainted with the basics.</p>

<p>I evaluated a total of 20 essays for 5 students. Some of them really moved me. I had taught many students for many months before this, but this was the first time I got to know them personally. It has made me appreciate the opportunities I have had and even changed my worldview a bit. Sharing a select few of these essays (anonymised of course) here:</p>

<p><strong>In my dad’s shoes…</strong> <br>
<!--**Share with us an important personal experience, which has significantly shaped you and your perspective(s) on life.**--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The past few months have been hard on all of us, but particularly for those from the economically weaker sections of society. Unfortunately, my family is one of them. My father works as a watchman to provide for all of us. And as the entire country went into a strict lockdown, especially Pune, his salary was reduced by his employer. We did not have savings to fall back upon, and the situation at our home was very difficult this summer.</p>

  <p>I really wanted to help and started looking for jobs and initially wanted to work as a delivery boy. But since I did not have a bike, I had to keep looking. The only other place where I could find employment was in a small security services company which was essentially the job of a watchman. My father was strictly against this. He said, “I’ve not raised you and put you through so much schooling and junior college for you to have to fall back to the same job as me”. But even he knew that we needed help, and after I convinced and promised him that this would only be temporary, he relented.</p>

  <p>I was working the night shift from 8pm to 8am during which I had to keep walking around the society. The very first day, as soon as I hit the bed, I realised how tiring this is. And the fact that my father has been doing this for us for the last 2 decades made me immensely grateful for my family. It’s not easy to take care of your loved ones. I worked as a watchman for 3 months until my dad was able to get back to work full-fledged, and now I am back to my studies. Since then I have made a pact with myself, I am going to see my education through and come what may, I will take away this hardship and give my parents the life they deserve, making their sacrifices worthwhile.

<p><strong>Apna time aayega</strong> <br>
<!-- **Reflect on a belief or opinion held by you, which you questioned and examined. What initiated your questioning?** --></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a student from a government school, my knowledge about the world of work was
limited. I used to do well in the bubble of my school, but education beyond a point was alien to us. Everyone in our community, including my own family would say, “just pass 10th” as that is the minimum requirement for getting a local job. It’s not that they were not supportive or did not believe in me, but rather that their aspirations were also limited because of their upbringing and opportunities.</p>

  <p>The turning point of my life was when me and my friend moved from our government school to a junior college with diverse students from privileged backgrounds. They spoke fluent English, came from fancy boards like IGCSE and CBSE, wore good clothes, were dropped and picked up by cars. These students would not consider us as friends since we could not speak fluent English, didn’t dress the same way, and thought we did not know anything. I remember ___ could not even afford shoes and would have to come in slippers every day. While we would study in a one-room house with our family, our classmates had air-conditioned rooms of their own.</p>

  <p>In the first week of junior college, there was a scholarship exam held to get into the premier batch for Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) preparation. __ placed 2nd and I placed 5th. We both received a 100% scholarship for the coaching which actually cost 3 lakh rupees. We did not speak polished English, nor were we rich, but we were on the same table with those who were from the city’s best schools. Now, these students would ask ‘us’ doubts in chemistry, maths and physics.</p>

  <p>This showed me that it is not our circumstances that decide our fate. It is our belief in ourselves and our actions that do. Circumstances like my community and my school need not limit my dreams. All that mattered was that a kid from a government school dreamt to succeed, and had the will to work and make his life and community better. I realised that students like me can not just dream big but do big.

<p><strong>No more school?</strong> <br>
<!--**Share with us an important personal experience, which has significantly shaped you and your perspective(s) on life.**--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I was in sixth grade, I had to choose between living with my parents in the village or apart from them in a city and continue my studies. I chose the latter and that’s the very reason I’m able to even write this essay and aspire to join such a prestigious college.</p>

  <p>I could easily have gotten distracted and not bothered about academics. If I had chosen to stay back, I’d have started working in the farms like my friends and would have never known my capabilities.</p>

  <p>My parents are equally important in leading me here. They had faith in me and gave me the choice. It would have been difficult for them as well, but they chose to educate me. Now I am an educated 19-year-old, the first one from my family to reach class 12 and even dare to dream of graduation.

<p><strong>Football and tragedy</strong> <br>
<!-- **We are keen to know about your life journey so far.

<blockquote>
  <p>I am <em>__. My family migrated to Pune from __</em> in search of employment. I enrolled into a government school in Yerwada and fortunately met amazing teachers from TeachForIndia who made me realize my passion for playing football. When I was in fourth standard, I tasted my first real victory. For the first time in my life I played in a tournament. Not just any tournament, the one started by us, the JustForKicks (JFK) tournaments. It was a Design For Change project that my class started and eventually it spread to six cities across India. While we would practice, __ Bhiaya would inspire us with stories of great players like Messi, Ronaldo, Pele, Maradona and many more.the way we practiced, I was confident about winning this tournament, but we lost in the semi-finals. I cried my heart out and just couldn’t believe that we lost the match.</p>

  <p>After the match I remember ___ Bhiaya telling us that “You cannot become a player in one day and your team cannot become champions in one tournament. Everyone who has been successful has failed many times in life. Messi started playing football at the age of five. He touches the ball a thousand times in a day, and only then he has become what he is today. It takes thousands of hours of practice to get perfect in something. It’s not easy, but it is possible.  With hardwork and determination you will win one day. Our life is also the same. You will never get success in a day or a year. You need to consistently practice and keep growing”.</p>

  <p>that day I decided, I will work harder. I went to practice the next day. We practiced day and night, and took care of our health. This was not easy. There were many challenges on our way. We helped our teammates in need. We talked to our parents and convinced them when they felt we were misled. We lost but kept going on. There was a time when we were one of the best teams in JFK but couldn’t lift the trophy. We were getting stronger day by day, we could see the changes in ourselves and in our team. Now, we were like a family. We slept at each other’s house to be on time for the practice as some of us lived far. When our family members would go to the village, we used to go to ___ bhaiya’s house. Now we were not playing for the trophy, but we enjoyed the game. We felt a different connection with football. The field was our home and the team was our family.</p>

  <p>While all of this was happening at school, I had a whole different story playing at my home. In sixth grade, my mom and dad went back to our village because we did not have anything in the city to fulfill our basic needs. I made one of the tough choices of my life. I wanted to study and play football so I convinced them that I would live in Pune with my uncle and aunt and  they agreed. Honestly, it was very difficult to live without parents at that age. I played football for my school team and managed studies as well.</p>

  <p>I was a bright student in class and a good sportsman on the field. Everything was going well, until one day in seventh grade, I got a call from my village that my father passed away. We rushed to the village. I was hopeless and shattered and in a lot of pain when, for the first time, I saw my mother crying. She suddenly became the sole person to raise 3 sons and I was the eldest. She expected me to help her out.</p>

  <p>When I came back to Pune, I was on the field right the next day. Football now was not just a game for me, but a means of expression.

<p><strong>Sexuality and Abuse</strong> <br>
<!-- **We are keen to know about your life journey so far.

<blockquote>
  <p>Being real is the most difficult thing to be but being real makes your life so much easier. I have no gender, something beyond male and female, something beyond limitations, something more beautiful. Biologically I am a part of this gender system, but for society and culture, we don’t exist. According to society, gender is only about male and female, not more than that. Then where do I stand?</p>

  <p>I was born in Kolhapur, a city of wrestlers. I was the first and the last child in the house, so I was everyone’s favourite. My parents didn’t give me everything I asked for, but they made sure I didn’t have to compromise on my basic needs. My parents could not afford private schools’ fees, so they admitted me to a government school. I was always excited about going to school and meeting new people. I made many friends, learned new things, and enjoyed my school. As I grew, the circumstances changed. As an 8-year-old, oddly behaved boy, my classmates started calling me a girl. I was bullied for my sexuality and ‘behaving like a girl’. I never understood the meaning of ‘acting like a boy’. It kept getting worse with time. People started making fun of my sexuality. Everything around me made me feel different from my peers; I felt like I didn’t fit in. Everyone behaved like was not one among them and I always felt ostracised.</p>

  <p>These circumstances forced me to alter myself, to change the way I was. I tried to behave like a straight boy. I showed how strong I was; I stopped sobbing; I spoke with a deep musculine voice, just to be like them. For me, it was like wearing a mask everywhere I went. I was in 8th grade when some of my classmates sexually abused me. This incident broke me from within. I went through a lot of mental stress. I never showed the pain I was going through. I was afraid to face the world, open up to people, and have eye contact with anyone. The thoughts in my head were eating me from inside, and one day I thought of attempting to end it all. I thought this was the last option, but I was wrong.</p>

  <p>I underwent some counselling sessions in my school. My teachers made a comfortable environment for me. I realized that just because the world is not Ok with you doesn’t mean, you have to change, be yourself and go-ahead. I decided to overcome my fear and take off this mask.  My passion for drama, added with immense support from my teachers, allowed me to hone my skills and explore the world of art and drama. I worked hard to get out of the fear of facing people, and my dedication paid off as I was offered a lead role in my school’s annual function. Currently, I am working with a theatre group, <em>_. I was also selected as one among __</em> to perform in in France! Now I am sure that being myself can’t stop me from achieving my goals and dreams.

<p><strong>Mixed gender relationships</strong> <br>
<!-- **Reflect on a belief or opinion held by you, which you questioned and examined. What initiated your questioning?** --></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As a teenager from a conservative family and a government school, I also was led to believe that there was something unnatural about a boy and girl being friends. It seemed that knowing someone of another gender well had to mean that you were in a relationship.</p>

  <p>During a play that we both took part in, I made my first real female friend, ___. But I was taken aback when I saw how everyone around us would think about our friendship. Friends would make fun of us or whisper behind our backs, teachers would ask us to sit apart. And even outside school, I was disturbed by the number of eyes that would follow us in public.</p>

  <p>Given all this, I also thought that something might be wrong and I asked <em>__</em> about what she thought. She explained that unfortunately, this is the way people think and that we should not be bothered. She was glad I talked it out instead of presuming anything.</p>

  <p>As time passed, I realised how different a girl’s perspective is on the same things that I take for granted. While I was expected to find my interest and pursue a career; girls, especially from our lower-income communities, were almost always led to believe that marriage is the ultimate achievement. Convincing my parents to be patient and let me pursue a college education, seeking need-based scholarships etc is itself a challenge. I never appreciated how much harder it is for my own female classmates whose parents are keen on getting them married by the age of 20 and question the need for any college education for them.</p>

  <p>For me, it was totally normal to go for my JEE coaching after college and come back by bus at 8 pm but girls were not permitted to travel so far after sunset due to safety issues. All this along with tiptoeing around difficulties related to menstruation adds up to so many restrictions and difficulties in a woman’s life.</p>

  <p>It’s not that I did not ‘know’ about any of these problems myself. But having a female peer’s perspective just made it all so real. Since then I have been able to appreciate the accomplishments of women around me much more and this has also taught me the value of a diverse perspective.
