<p>Hi, I am Tejaswa Gavankar. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px" /> I work in the technology division of Credit Suisse, a major global financial firm.</p>

<p>With regard to my professional skills, I would call myself an E-shaped technologist. I code in python, primarily for back end of big data and Google cloud.</p>

<p>I am good at exploring new technologies for greenfield projects and scaling them from PoC to production.</p>

<p>I love working with people as much as I love technology. I have played a significant part in Credit Suisse Indiaâ€™s Branding and Collaboration workstreams. I have organised the firmâ€™s partnerships with major events like Pune Agile UnConference and Grace Hooper Celebration. Iâ€™ve also organised events that have reached over 5000 employees.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m always upto something fun outside work. Over the last year I have been seriously engaged with educational non-profits and I also do some other projects to stay sharp.</p>
