<p>When I was playing with GPT2, <a href="https://github.com/swahareddy/gpt2AI_whatsapp_simulation">teaching it to talk like my friends</a>, I was feeding the untrained model random internet snippets. And some of the stuff it was dropping was mind blowing. I could see why OpenAI was worried about fake news like applications of this.</p>

  <p>I gave it the first sentence from <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Abhinandan_Varthaman">this</a> wikipedia page. Going forward, I will be <strong>denoting the input in bold</strong> and the text that follows will be the output.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman VrC (born 21 June 1983) is an Indian Air Force fighter pilot who,[3][4] during the 2019 India‚ÄìPakistan standoff, was held captive in Pakistan for 60 hours after his aircraft was shot down in an aerial dogfight.</strong> He did not know when, or why, he was captured, however, he had been deployed on an Indian airbase to a ‚Äúterrorist safe haven,‚Äù where to say ‚Äúthese are my terrorists.‚Äù[10]
His name was Abhinandan, during the battle.In 1940, at the age of twelve, he went to Syria to fight with the Chinese Empire.[14] He was in a situation in which the two American servicemen were in battle to protect them from friendly fire from China.[13]</p>

  <p>In 1946, Abhinandan was in the Indian Air Force as part of a Special Observership Program, which allowed him or the other pilots in Indian Air Force air-force combat planes to fly without being ‚Äúsatellites‚Äù.[18] However, he had lost several other pilots, and he would not be able to perform the operation if he was flown to an Indian airbase.</p>

  <p>In 1946, during the Indian Army‚Äôs losses from an Indian plane crash, Abhinandan was given the task of flying a Apache and other AN-100/US/IM-100 aircraft. He was given the task of flying a AN-100 aircraft that was to carry up to 8 more squadrons of 8 aircraft, which consisted of 15 of the aircraft each, with the number of aircraft flown by all American and Russian Air Force, which included two of the planes being used by Mr. V.V.) Abhinandan had been assigned to the United States Air Force, and had been assigned to India from the Department of Defense‚Äôs Special Observership Program (FSPP).</p>

<p>So I really wanted to be able to tell stories based off images. But I needed a few lines of text based on the image to feed as context to the model. And the Google cloud APIs I found were for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/labels">individual labels</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/object-localizer">object detection</a>^. So I left it at that.</p>

<p>But recently I came across <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/neuraltalk2">this</a> open source model to auto-caption images. (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.reveal">This</a> app by Google is also really cool) Unfortunately I was unable to install it due to my laptop (and google colab) being incompatible, but I am still documenting my non technical observations in this post.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text-generator">this</a> tool to make the text predictions as it gives large outputs. A better one is <a href="https://transformer.huggingface.co/doc/gpt2-large">this</a> since GPT2 prediction parameters can be controlled, but it predicts only few words at a time. In reality I will want a combination of both like I have <a href="https://github.com/swahareddy/gpt2AI_whatsapp_simulation/blob/master/Whatsapp_Chat_simulation_by_OpenAI's_GPT_2.ipynb">done earlier</a>.</p>

<strong>a man riding a wave on top of a surfboard</strong> 
I was riding high on a wave at Ormeau Surf and Rimming and Wetland. On the way, I stopped at the water board for a short delay.
The guy who was riding in a wave tank was clearly a person from different parties, a lot like the one I was in Australia at the time.
He was dressed in a green shirt with a gold hoop earring and no headscarves.
I rode my wave there for just one second before it stopped raining.
What prompted the ride? ‚ÄúI suppose I shouldn‚Äôt throw up‚Äù, I say confidently as I wait out the door.</p>

  <p>‚ÄúMy friends were out of town when they caught me surf surfing. As I stopped at a water board, I realised it was getting really long. I looked at the front side mirror and realised where I was going. I pulled the paddle out of the water, excitedly scooped it up and stepped over the side. The wave crashed out into the side of the board.
I got out of the water and took a break to rest. When I came back on to the board, I pulled my head back and gingerly pulled it out. The other paddleboarders, who were right next to me, were still running along with me. I could feel the wind shifting in my face.</p>

There‚Äôs a great story here. In 2013, NASA released the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The mission was a cooperative effort between NASA, the European Space Agency and several European member states.</p>

  <p>At the time, NASA had just launched its Mars Polar Satellite, an attempt to collect data on the global water circulation network in Mars. A computer model developed by Nasa meant it had a pretty complicated record: Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was taking a detailed look at water distribution in the Martian atmosphere, it had to track the surface at a scale previously used to catalog the planet‚Äôs surface and track the movement patterns of water molecules.</p>

<hr />
<p>As you can see the outputs are not what anyone would have liked. But I still have not given up hope because the issue with using NeuralTalk type models is that are trained on the <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#explore">COCO dataset</a> which <strong>gives crisp outputs that are not sufficient context for a good GPT output.</strong></p>

<p><em>I want to try a more raw NLP approach like comparing the embeddings of a group of ^detected labels/ objects with that of wikipedia or some other very large corpus to find well written sentence(s) that can be fed instead of crisp captions.</em></p>
