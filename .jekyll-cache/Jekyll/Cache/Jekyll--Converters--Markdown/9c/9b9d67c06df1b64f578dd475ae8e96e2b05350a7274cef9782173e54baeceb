I"S<p>I recently read Nir Eyal’s book- <strong>Hooked: How to build habit-forming products</strong>
<!-- https://www.slideshare.net/nireyal/the-secret-psychology-of-snapchat --></p>

<p>And as a self-assigned homework assignment, I wanted to analyse ‘stories’ from the <em>hooked</em> perspective.</p>

<p>Just to get everyone on the same page, what I mean by stories is this:</p>

<p><strong>Instagram:</strong> <br />

<p><strong>Snapchat</strong><br /></p>

<p><strong>Facebook</strong><br /></p>

<p>So how would you define a <em>story</em>? This definition ofc differs among different platforms, and even within the same platform, the way public and DM stories (for example) work are different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A full-screen appearance on content with ephemeral presence and an expiry time (usually 24h).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But breaking down just the essentials:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full screen</strong> A pretty simple feature, but one that has the most value. Unlike a post that is packed inside the app’s UI which is already inside the OS’s UI, stories take advantage of almost 2x real estate on your screen. And this captures <em>all of your attention</em> .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ephemeral presence</strong>. The story once opened disappears. If its a public story it fades back into the story rack and if its a DM story, it can even disappear for ever. Why is this good? Because again you have <em>all their attention</em>. Checking stories demands a certain engagement which simply is not there when someone is casually running through their wall.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Expiry</strong>. From a user behavior perspective, this was a gamechanger. Even today, stories are primarily visual content. And stories offered a way of sharing (your images) with your network <strong>without the anxiety</strong> of chasing perfect images, filters and captions that was common with existing apps like Instagram. Of course the quality of stories has since matured, but it’s still <strong>distinctly more honest</strong> than posts. <br />And Instagram highlights now lets you catalog your stories too, so the good stories can be made permanent if you wish to do so.

</ol>
