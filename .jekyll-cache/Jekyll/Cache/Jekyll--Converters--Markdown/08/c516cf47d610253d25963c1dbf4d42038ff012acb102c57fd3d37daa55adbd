    Am I proud that I would get better reviews of my memes than my work?<br> Maybe the fact that I wasted time making the collage below should give you an answer.<br><br>
    *But disclaimer*: I share way more memes than I actually make.<br><br>
    I'm not sharing memes here, since their templates are too dynamic anyway.<br>But if you're interested, you should <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reddyswaha/" class="icon brands alt fa-facebook-f"><span class="label"></span> follow me on Facebook</a>, it's almost all that I do ğŸ™.
