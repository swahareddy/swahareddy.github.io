<img src="media_polarisation_images\2d_scale.jpg" alt="alt_text" width="70%" />
<br />Like this:<br />

<h2 id="my-idea">My idea:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Define a right and left wing corpus with words that those wings are usually associated with
    <ol>
      <li>Manually decide 20-30 accounts (politicians, commentators, spokespersons etc..) each from right and left wing for loud polarised people</li>
      <li>Use Twitter API to input tweets from them</li>
      <li>For every right-wing tweet:
        <ol>
          <li>Run GCP entity sentiment analysis</li>
          <li>Add entities with positive sentiment to right wing corpus</li>
          <li>Add entities with negative sentiment to left wing corpus</li>
          <li>There will be entities that are in both corpuses (‚Äòarmy‚Äô, ‚Äòmahatma gandhi‚Äô etc).</li>
          <li>Do vice-versa for left-wing tweets</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Now stream news like I did in <a href="/projects/news_negativity.html">my other project</a></li>
  <li>Run GCP entity sentiment analysis on news data</li>
  <li>Compare these entity sentiments with the above defined corpora</li>
  <li>Calculate difference in % match</li>
  <li>Scatter plot and clustering of different news sources</li>
</ol>

<p>These corpora would be at a national level, not same corpora for all international sources</p>

<p>This could be extended to do the same for transcripts from YouTube videos of NDTV, Republic TV etc (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-2110.pdf">a data science heavy project</a>)</p>

<p>As I have read more about this, I have come to understand that using the concepts of right and left in India is not meaningful. If we have to we can do a pro-vs-anti government scale.</p>
