        Am I proud that I would get better reviews of my memes than my work?<br /> Maybe the fact that I wasted time making the collage below should give you an answer.<br />
        *But disclaimer*: I share way more memes than I actually make.

        I'm not sharing memes here, since their templates are too dynamic anyway.<br />But if you're interested, you should <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reddyswaha/" class="icon brands alt fa-facebook-f"><span class="label"></span> follow me on Facebook</a>, it's almost all that I do üôÅ.
