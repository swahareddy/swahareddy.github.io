<p>One of the easiest dashboards I have made. Particularly since the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bIxNFQmPRpb_SoXTooEJ68SAH60S7Ups5J18iCuug2o/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> need not be cleaned so you can just reuse the template. Scroll down for instructions. 19,000 streamed songs in a year.</p>

<p>Optional: This is thanks to EU’s <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/privacy/#privacy-center-rights"><abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></a> which mandates that consumers should have access to the company’s data about them. And even though I use Spotify in a non EU country, the fact that they are headquartered in Sweden (in EU) and they rely on a cloud provider that would have global resources means that I am eligible for <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>’s rights too.</p>

<p><strong>To make this for yourself, just follow the instructions from <a href="https://thenextweb.com/tech/2020/06/19/a-simple-guide-to-visualising-your-spotify-listening-data-badass-ly/">here</a>.</strong> I have edded a lot more visualisations in my dashboard, so you might want to copy my report instead. You’ll just have to add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">secPlayed</code> field (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=msPlayed/1000</code>) in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manage added data sources</code>.</p>

<p>This project leads to two other thoughts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Spotify provides some amazing information of songs (happiness, dance-ability, tempo, album cover etc) through <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/">APIs</a>. Connecting to those APIs can lead to more interesting and even <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/widgets/">interactive</a> apps.</li>
  <li>I should explore more of my <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>-enabled-data to see what can be inferred. Starting with <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/dashboard">google</a>?</li>
</ol>
