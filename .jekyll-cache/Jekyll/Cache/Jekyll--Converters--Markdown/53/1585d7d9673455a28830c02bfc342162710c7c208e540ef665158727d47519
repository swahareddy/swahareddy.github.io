I"ñ<p>I have a lot of project ideas that I note down, hoping to either read more and implement them or discard for being impractical. I am always looking for someone to collaborate with to make them happen. Thatâ€™s why I am making a note of some of them here.</p>

<p>If any of these interest you and you want to bounce ideas (even without actually getting involved with code), please reach out to me at one of the social media links mentioned at the end of this page.</p>
