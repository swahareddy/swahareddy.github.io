<h1 id="part-3">Part 3</h1>
<p>Due to the lockdowns, iTeach decided to pilot an online course from April. In a change from my earlier role, I was asked to mentor students whoâ€™d just completed their 12th and were now in limbo till their colleges would open.</p>

<p>The challenge here was of syllabus, rather than attendance or enthusiasm. What do you teach a mixed (Arts, Commerce, Science) group who are waiting to join college?</p>

<p>In Phase 1 of this program, our gang of 10 students created <em>resumes, LinkedIn profiles and had mock interviews. Following that we had classes on online tools like Google docs/sheets/forms, Gmail etc, touched on how to finances in and after college and weekly critical thinking essays</em>.</p>

<p>In Phase 2 of this program, we did the really fun stuff. <em>Weekly news briefings with each â€˜anchorâ€™, interactive session on cyber security, time management techniques and a recap of post Independence Indian history</em>.</p>
