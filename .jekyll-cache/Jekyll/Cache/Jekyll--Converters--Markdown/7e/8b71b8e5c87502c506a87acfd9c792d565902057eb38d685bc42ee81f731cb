I")<p>Money matters, no doubt about it. While I do give a lot of weekends towards helping non-profits in skill-based activities, the impact that a full-time teacher, better infra or being able to afford to school another child is probably always going to be more than what I can do in a few weekend hours. And hey, why not both?</p>

<p>I read somewhere, that you should donate 5% of your income to charity. And as a %, that might not seem much. But if you actually calculate what it comes out to, its a pretty decent amount. I doubt most of us even give 1%.</p>

<p>So, inspired by Jack Dorsey‚Äôs tracker, I decided to create one for myself. Even if no one reads this blog, I will atleast hold myself accountable since I have put it out there.</p>

<p>I think the 5% number is too high for me right now since I will very soon need to finance major life events, but I am going to be shooting for 2-3%. And I since its the first time, I am setting <strong>my target as ‚Çπ20,000 for this year.</strong></p>
