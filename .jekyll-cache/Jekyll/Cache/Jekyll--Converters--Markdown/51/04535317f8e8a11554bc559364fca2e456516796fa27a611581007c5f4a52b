<p>As part of this program, I taught macroeconomics to sophomore and junior students from computer science at the <u>Army Institute of Technology</u>. <em>The best part of this was to go from being a student of this course in 2018 during my senior year at <a href="https://www.coep.org.in">COEP</a>, to being a faculty in 2020 as an employee with the bank</em></p>

<p>It was a very enriching experience to learn something new in depth. I had not realised the exponential level of difference in <em>knowing the syllabus</em> vs <em>being able to answer doubts in that syllabus</em>.</p>

<p>I studied a couple of online resources, and most importantly the <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Introductory-Macroeconomics-Textbook-Economics-Class/dp/8174507159">NCERT Macroeconomics textbook</a> for a month to be confident enough to teach.
