<p>I have always had a nudge to know about US History. I mean almost all that I knew is that the British were once there, they harmed native Indians and the civil war abolished slavery.</p>

<p>My trigger to finally learn about it was after watching the Hamilton musical (sadly on Hotstar, not live). I came across this <strong>beautiful</strong> web series. It took me 2 weeks before I realised that the host <em>John Green</em> is the John Green from <em>Fault in Our Stars</em> fame</p>
