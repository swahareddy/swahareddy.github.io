I"¯<p>I recently read Nir Eyalâ€™s book- <strong>Hooked: How to build habit-forming products</strong>
<!-- https://www.slideshare.net/nireyal/the-secret-psychology-of-snapchat --></p>

<p>And as a self-assigned homework assignment, I wanted to analyse â€˜storiesâ€™ from the <em>hooked</em> perspective.</p>

<p>Just to get everyone on the same page, what I mean by stories is this:</p>

<p><strong>Instagram:</strong> <br />

<p><strong>Snapchat</strong><br /></p>

<p>There are a lot more platforms*, Facebook, Whatsapp and YouTube being other visible examples. Even Skype and Medium apparently have their versions of it and LinkedIn is recently launched it too. They have various names - fleets, snaps, statuses and reels, but Iâ€™ll be using â€˜storyâ€™ as a broad name for them all.</p>

<p>So how would you define a <em>story</em>? This definition of course differs among different platforms, and even within the same platform, the way public and DM stories (for example) work are different.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A full-screen appearance on content with ephemeral presence and an expiry time (usually 24h).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But breaking down just the essentials:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Full screen</strong> A pretty simple feature, but one that has the most value. Unlike a post that is packed inside the appâ€™s UI which is already inside the OSâ€™s UI, stories take advantage of almost 2x real estate on your screen. And this captures <em>all of your attention</em> .</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ephemeral presence</strong>. The story once opened disappears. If its a public story it fades back into the story rack and if its a DM story, it can even disappear for ever. Why is this good? Because again you have <em>all their attention</em>. Checking stories demands a certain engagement which simply is not there when someone is casually running through their wall.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Expiry</strong>. From a user behavior perspective, this was a gamechanger. Even today, stories are primarily visual content. And stories offered a way of sharing (your images) with your network <strong>without the anxiety</strong> of chasing perfect images, filters and captions that was common with existing apps like Instagram. Of course the quality of stories has since matured, but itâ€™s still <strong>distinctly more honest</strong> than posts. <br />And Instagram highlights now lets you catalog your stories too, so the good stories can be made permanent if you wish to do so.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Not just consumers, but stories have been amazing for brands too. The real-time engagement that you would earlier have had only on slowly aging Facebook or intellectual twitter is now possible on Instagram too, especially important since Instagram and Snapchat are a clear winners in the 21-40 age groups.</p>

<h1 id="now-what-is-this-hooked-model">Now what is this â€˜Hookedâ€™ model?</h1>
<p>Its a model of how habits (or addictions) can be created, explained in (although not limited to) a technological context. This has been created by Nir Eyal, an industry veteran, author and lecturer whoâ€™s work is a part of BSchool curriculums. You can find the preview and purchase link for the book <a href="books2020.html">here</a>!

<h2 id="trigger">Trigger</h2>

<p>Triggers can be :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>External</strong> - Notifications are the most obvious. Yes, the ones that say â€˜Tejaswa mentioned you in a storyâ€™ and â€˜TanmyaBhatt is now liveâ€™ are direct triggers for stories. But more than that, I believe the placement of stories in the appâ€™s UI is the most effective external trigger. They get prime real estate at the top of the appâ€™s home page and youâ€™re also reminded in between your non-story usage of that application.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an amazing PPT about what works for Snapchat. One thing that I donâ€™t see anyone mentioning are â€˜streaksâ€™. Snapstreaks were such an addictive way to keep users coming back every day. I myself would maintain streaks sometimes and in hindsight its such a value-less feature whoâ€™s purpose is almost exclusively to build MAUs, a marvel of user behaviour engineering if there ever was one!</p>
