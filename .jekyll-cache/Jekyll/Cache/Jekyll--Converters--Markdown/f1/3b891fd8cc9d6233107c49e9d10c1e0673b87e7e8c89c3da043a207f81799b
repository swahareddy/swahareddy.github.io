I"ÿ<p>I am unabashedly proud of the fact that I would have better reviews of my memes than my work.</p>

<p><em>But disclaimer</em>: I share way more memes than I actually make.</p>

<p>There is no point in sharing too many memes here, since their templates are quite dynamic. <br />But if youâ€™re interested, you should <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reddyswaha/" class="icon brands alt fa-facebook-f"><span class="label"></span> follow me on Facebook</a>.</p>
