  <p>An (mobile) app to help you solve a jigsaw puzzle. IN the larger 10000 piece type puzzles it is often frustrating to solve it half way and run out of enthusiasm or worse trying to determine how the 40 pieces representing the clear blue sky are supposed to correctly align.</p>

<h2 id="user-experience">User experience:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>You provide a photo of the image the puzzleâ€™s actual image.</li>
  <li>You provide the <em>resolution</em> of the puzzle. i.e. Number of pieces (Eg - 50x30)</li>
  <li>You provide a photo of a piece from that puzzle and the app will tell you where it should go (or top possible choices in case itâ€™s ambiguous).</li>

      <p>These guys have created a software to solve the puzzle <a href="https://www.abtosoftware.com/blog/computer-vision-powers-automatic-jigsaw-puzzle-solver">simply by looking at the pieces</a>! They do not need to know how the end state even looks like.</p>

  <li>An important part of this will be to have good quality images of the puzzle. (Similar lighting glare on both the puzzle picture and the piece you are looking to place).</li>
  <li>While we might be <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Scale-invariant_feature_transform">matching</a> the piece based on the rectangular <em>resolution</em>, in reality the puzzle piece is <em>jigsawed</em> and hence can lead to false positives. What to do about that?
