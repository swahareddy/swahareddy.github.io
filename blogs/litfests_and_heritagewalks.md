title: Heritage walks and Literature Fests

One good thing that came about from the global lockdown for me was the virtualization of so many events. I have attended  TATA Lit Live in Mumbai, Microsoft Ignite in New Orleans, Kala Ghoda in Mumbai, Khaki Lab's talks about Maharashtra, and Jaipur Lit Fest in Rajasthan without having to take leaves, travel, and the usual excuses. 

I have compiled some of these resources, and I hope if you are as geeky as me, you'll take back something from these:

While the organisers have not released recordings of the talks, I was aable to figure out that their stream was just a masked YT Live, and I have collected the links for some of the days here
