Verbal jijutsu

Think about:
1. Audience
- Understanding their level of understanding 
- Empathize
        - How much do they like you
        - Will they be concerned about time/$/effort..
- Their position in the organization, their seniority
- Psychological distance b/w you and them
2. Context of communication:
- Time. Mornings are more collaborative.
- Sequence. What was the last meeting for this group. How are they feeling when I go in.
3. Goal
- Goal is not to do the PPT, but to leave listener with a certain sense.
- What should the listener:
	    1. Know
	    2. Feel 
	    3. Do
- Defining a goal lets you evaluate success too.
- Be creative about the communication challenge:
	    - time-boxed brainstorming (design thinking)
	    - mind maps
	    - How do analogous situations do it. Eg:
		        - ER docs looked at F1 pit-crews
		        - Apple genius bar inspired by hotel concierges
- 6 WORD STORIES:  Distill what you want to accomplish into a 6 word mantra
4. Structure
- Proven to lead to more retention. Set expectations at the start.
        - What? (what am I talking about?)
        - So what? (why should you care?)
        - Now what? (what do we do next? when do we meet?)
- Sometimes there are expected structures. Like investors looking for 7 viewpoints to be considered. Ask around and use them.
5. Feedback

Physical presence:
- Pull shoulder blades back (puffs chest) to show confidence. Nervous people shrink or sit back. Confident people have a large presence
- In 1:1 interactions leaning your head is better. But in 1:many delivery, looking straight ahead shows confidence. Above shoulder blades trick naturally causes that.
- Standing > Sitting. Better non-verbal comm.
- Swaying sucks. If sitting lock your chair, don't swivel. If standing, don't sway foot-to-foot. Consider keeping one leg on a box. That way you will not sway.
- Virtual communication:
	- Be well-lit.
	- Fill half the screen, don't be far. Face is important.
	- Overhead camera, not under like laptops
	- Watch your recording. Best teacher.
Speaking
- Insert emotive words to cause natural voice modulation
