>iTeach's Certified Peer Learning Program is a weekend educational program where professionals from various dsiciplines teach students from low income backgrounds. The program covers STEM, Arts and Commerce along with non technical life-skills.

# Part 1
Since January this year I've been volunteering with iTeach on Sundays. iTeach is an NGO that provides quality high school education to the less fortunate. I mentored students from class XI in Mathematics and Physics. It was a lot of fun revisiting these concepts. <br>**Highlights** - Climbing on the table to drop the duster to approximate g=9.8 ms-2, making weird noises to demonstrate the doppler effect and introducing them to graphs through [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/)

Its been a whole cycle, and I have a new found appreciation for teachers. Its not at all easy! Especially recent grads, you should try such an experience ðŸ˜›
Working on something interesting right now with the kids since its a unique combination of summer vacations and the lockdown.

# Part 2
While teaching PCM (context -  a special project that we initiated with our students at iTeach was 'Opportunities after XIIth'. I've always felt that its really unfortunate that 'science after 10th', 'BTech/MBBS after 12th' have become a norm, putting a dampener on so many other exciting careers.

So, for over 2 hours, we covered non-traditional fields like design, architecture, planning and defence services. And within the traditional route also we explained the distinction between major engineering and medical branches. For some of the fields, qualified people shared their experiences over video (Thanks Ayush Poddar, Tripti Rajput and JS Gavankar!). 
We ended with a note of the financial assistance provided at a central/state and institute level.

It's a pretty comprehensive deck, [take a look, and do reuse](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/mobile/folders/1uCIGXLmXqIXPEvD4SaDop0_hKOe7gXhT) if it can help anyone else ðŸ˜‡
