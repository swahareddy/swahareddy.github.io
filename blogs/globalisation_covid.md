>Strangely, I don't hold President Trump fully accountable for the lack of supplies for hospitals. He may have been 6 weeks too late but die was cast long time ago.

>Starting in eighties, Just in Time Manufacturing and Asset Light strategies started being popularized by consultancies like McKinsey to promote efficiencies. Inventories are an inefficient use of capital, stick to your core competency, outsource non essential functions. Also, cut the capacity to improve asset utilization. This got the ball rolling. Holding inventory was for the suckers. Low value added manufacturing was to be shifted to low cost countries.

>After all, this did improve the profitability quite a bit but at it came at the expense of security. There are fewer hospital beds not than we had 20 years ago. all the spare capacity in the system got eliminated.
>I see this pandemic serving notice that we went too far. We are going to have to build strategic reserves/stockpiles. We are going to have spare and local capacity to respond to emergencies.
>Efficiencies will be achieved by other means. AI and Robotics will be speeded up. Flexibility of manufacturing will be at premium.

And in addition to the lack of inventory, the second age of globalisation might face it's the biggest challenge yet due to the realisation of the dependence on global supply chains.

We obviously know of US demanding hydroxychloroquine from India, Europe waiting on Chinese delivery of N95 masks and other such essential services, but the lockdowns have caused all kinds of manufacturers (automobiles, electronics, drugs etc) to heavily slow down, if not shut down production and declare force majeure since things down the chain, are literally all over the place.

The stage was already set with Brexit, 'Make in India', 'Make America great again' and the growth of the nationalism rhetoric among world leaders. As mentioned below, it will almost certainly be a whole new world in the production and manufacturing space.
