# Part 3
Due to the lockdowns, iTeach decided to pilot an online course from April. In a change from my earlier role, I was asked to mentor students who'd just completed their 12th and were now in limbo till their colleges would open.

The challenge here was of syllabus, rather than attendance or enthusiasm. What do you teach a mixed (Arts, Commerce, Science) group who are waiting to join college?

In Phase 1 of this program, our gang of 10 students created *resumes, LinkedIn profiles and had mock interviews. Following that we had classes on online tools like Google docs/sheets/forms, Gmail etc, touched on how to finances in and after college and weekly critical thinking essays*.

In Phase 2 of this program, we did the really fun stuff. *Weekly news briefings with each 'anchor', interactive session on cyber security, time management techniques and a recap of post Independence Indian history*.
