I have always had a nudge to know about US History. I mean almost all that I knew is that the British were once there, they harmed native Indians and the civil war abolished slavery.

My trigger to finally learn about it was after watching the [Hamilton musical (sadly on Hotstar](https://www.hotstar.com/in/movies/hamilton/1260032145), not live). I came across this [**beautiful web series**](). It took me 2 weeks before I realised that the host *John Green* is the John Green from *Fault in Our Stars* fame.

Its a 48 part series which I saw in increments everyday while washing dishes during the COvid-19 lockdown.
