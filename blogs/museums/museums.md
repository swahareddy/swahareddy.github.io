A short blog about me questioning a museum's purpose. Arguing that they should worry visitor education instead of boasting of their balance sheet. 

What do you go to a museum for?
To learn about something right?
Natural History, civilization, science, culture, what have you.

But the way museums are designed today seem to serve more of a purpose as stores of art rather than educational institutions. A display of beautiful, rare, and ancient antiques, arranged by a a theme, sure. But still lacking a relevance to today.

What about learning history? What's the point? I'd say there isn't any point, of you'd have asked me in 6th Grade. Today, I'm in love with it. It educates me about progress, innovation and all things great about life. It reminds me that some things never change and we're silly not to heed. It shows me evidences of the butterfly effect if I think with depth.

Archeologists find treasures, museum curators collect them, historians write the stories, and teachers tell them to us. And if teachers teach us the theory, museums should teach us the practical side of it. Bring the magic back for kids and even remind the adults of what they might have forgotten. They already have the artifact! All they need is the storytelling.

Rather than see 112 pieces of 2000 year old pots and pans from the Indus Valley civilization, I'd rather see how pottery has changed over time. What is the same over centuries, what isn't, and why? Start with 20 pieces from the Indus Valley. Then let's talk about how Chinaware went from a status of wealth to $24.99 at Target. Innovations like Teflon gave us non-stick pans. Plastic was great, but cancer isn't, so we came up with Microwave-safe bowls.

Here's an old image of downtown Los Angeles.

You know what would be awesome? A then-vs-now comparison. Click a picture of that spot from the same vantage point and lighting and frame it next to the old one. That'd make me squint at the old picture or painting some more, appreciate it far more than what I would in my slow shuffle across the gallery.

One of the few museums I felt this in practice was at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C.

American museums also often have a gift shop at the end. So do National Parks. These are no just selling snacks and seeking donations, but rather have a well crafted collection of products. Some examples - When I went to the NY Transit Museum at the Grand Central Terminal earlier this month, I got my friend a shot glass with Brooklyn's subway map since that's where he used to stay. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art you can purchase chocolates that look like Van Gogh's paintings. At the national parks you can purchase plushies of the animals found in those forests.

Well crafted stores can be part of the STORiES. See what I did there? Such humour. (A) People are very likely to purchase something right after their emotional/intellectual high about the very topic and (B) Taking a relevant momento back home serves as a reminder of the history the museum was trying to bring to life.

Here's another interesting application of this theory - "historybymail.com"
It is a monthly delivery of a lifelike replica of an important historical document mailed to you with a contect guide and quarterly theme. Just 5 years after launch, it is earning $1M+ in annual revenue. People are willing to pay $80/year for copies and narratives of objects. At the very least, the museums that house these artifacts should do a better job of holding the museum-goers interest!
