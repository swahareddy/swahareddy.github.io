I considered 4 geographies abroad:
1. **Europe**: After US, Europe was and is the most appealing to me. 
	- A distinct culture, opportunity to travel and work in multiple places.
	- European MBAs are usually 1-2 years. That's often viewed as an advantage since MBA's academics are considered fairly generic and it's more a platform and access to a network. Graduating a year earlier saves additional tuition fee and gets you earning sooner. I might be wishful in thinking, but knowing that this is going to be my last college experience I wanted to ride it out my MBA for two years, taking more courses that interest me and exploring more of my interests even at the cost of the RoI.
	- With all this however comes the challenge of securing work and learning languages. The major economy, UK, is not a part of the EU anymore (although UK has welcoming visa laws for MBAs). I was not confident about securing jobs in countries like France and Germany. Learning languages has never been a strong point of mine, and I did not want to be forced to have daily business communication in French/German (FYI, to graduate from INSEAD you must learn a new language during your MBA). 
	- A school like INSEAD practically guarantees visa sponsorship and placement across Europe. But I'm not sure about HEC, SDA etc that might be aligned towards their countries.
	- Lesser fees. 
	- (My take: European schools have more expectation on workex and lesser expectation of GMAT).
2. **Canada**: Navigating US' visa is a frustrating process. I do not appreciate being treated like a potential criminal despite being a honest high value contributor to the country's economy. Canada offers a lot of quality-of-life benefits that US does with a much more welcoming immigration system. In <5 years you can be a permanent resident (PR=no more visa!) and then follow that up with a citizenship. US on the other hand needs about 10 years to get a PR (green card), before which you might have H1B troubles and have to relocate.
3. **Singapore**: I did not research enough. But ease of travel to India is amazing and that can be a factor in decision making too.
4. **USA**: In the end I had personal reasons to choose the US. The quality of schools and the economy is unmatched. Canada often loses to US in these two categories.
