title: Airline Food, Yay or Nay?
---
You're trying to sleep on the flight. Your neck rolls side to side on the wing shaped economy class headrest, the discomfort amplified by the fact that you haven't stood up in 4 hours since it's awkward to ask the others to wake up to let you into the aisle. 

That's when you hear a familiar sound - "Chicken or Pasta?". You miss it at first, but then it appears again, this time from the other side of the aircraft, then again on your side. You inhale deeper, you can actually smell it. It's finally meal time!

I've always looked forward to inflight meals. I thought this was normal, but my wife thinks I'm nuts. Am I though? Obviously I like food, but in today's life where I can afford airport food or have lounge access, hunger is not the drive. To me the airline food tray (let's call it AFT going forward) represents a welcome distraction. Whether it's the Sunday at the end of your vacation and you are dreading work, frustration that time moves half as fast on long haul flights, inability to sleep sitting up ... the arrival of the AFT let's you forget all that.

Like a birthday baby, I get mine and get to unwrapping it. Neatly, as my dad taught me. The cellophane comes off the little square salad, the aluminum lid comes off the warm rectangular container, and the dessert is tucked in the corner, saved for later. For those 15 minutes with the AFT and a movie running right up in my face, I am right at home. Almost like I got takeout and pulled up my laptop. I have unwrapped the little butter too, even though my Indian self does not really know what to do with a solid cube of butter. But that doesn't stop me from polishing it and everything else off the tray go on to tidily consolidated the used containers, one inside the other like Tupperwares in the kitchen, and wait for the crew to circle back to pick for pick up.

The distraction theory for loving AFTs is probably applicable to you too, but I think there are two other reasons why I love them. Firstly, I watched a lot of National Geographic on TV growing up. One of my favorite shows was Megakitchens. These featured factories of Lays turning potatoes into packed chips, massive temples prepare food for devotees, and ... drumroll ... airline catering companies preparing meals for 10000+ passengers a day. So, to be onboard and be handed an AFT at 30,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean, in the final step in an incredibly complicated journey that feels magical.

Secondly, I missed the golden age of aviation where flying on PanAm meant suits, sofas and champagne. I did however experience the sliver age in the early 2000s, where flying was a privilege, people dressed nice, and meals onboard was a standard. Even as the world slipped into the bronze age where you could only get peanuts and drip coffee complementary, I still had a sliver of the silver age. Since my father worked in the government, employee benefits mandated (LTC back then) flying the flag carrier (Air India). So even though the rise of Indigo, Air Asia, and other depressing airlines, I got my AFT. This was the time when most people in my generation started flying, and thus began with no meal expectations.

But now, I need to pay for my own tickets :(
And so, you'll find me a frequent flyer of Alaska basic economy, a proud Spirit Savers club member, and plugging in my earphones to drown Indigo's cabin music. Instead of being asked "Chicken or Pasta?", I stare down the aisle waiting for the peanuts to pass. There's no inflight screen anymore, so I've awkwardly balanced my phone to stream something over the WifI. I take my time, eating one nut a time, atleast the silver age can be alive in my head. Maybe my wife is right about me being nuts.
