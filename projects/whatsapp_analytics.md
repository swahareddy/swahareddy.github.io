### What you need to run it yourself:
* A python/jupyter installation (run the `.py`/ `.ipynb` file respectively) or you can simply use an online tool like [Colab](http://colab.research.google.com/).
* A google cloud account setup. Use this [basic intro of GCP components](https://github.com/swahareddy/IndianMediaNegativity/blob/master/gcp_guide.md) and then follow [these steps](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/setup) (till 'use key in your env') if you are new to GCP.

## Comments  
> The cleaned message is the one sent to Google's natural language API for classification. Thus, that's what sentiment score and magnitude are based on.  
_Cleaned message + (Links + Emoticons + Emojis* + Tagged people + Garbage characters) = Original message_
*Emojis are conected to their text equivalent in the cleaned message. Eg: ðŸ˜“ --> downcast_face_with_sweat

* Removed system messages like _'..has left the group', '.. changed the description', '.. changed the group icon'_ etc..
* Ignored `<media ommitted>` that corresponds to images ad GIFs
* Extract URLs, emojis, emoticons from message. 

## Future scope
* _Tagged_ members are mentioned by mobile number. Eg `Hey @919167023114, are you going for the party?`. A simple function to map this number to your mobile's contacts [(export as csv)](https://contacts.google.com/) can reveal name of the person and provide another interesting dimension to the analysis about who tags whom etc.

## Limitations
* Whatsapp does not provide _'reply context'_. i.e. if a message B is in a repsonse to message A, there is no information about this in the `.txt` that you can export.
* Only recent media can be exported. Cannot perform straightforward analysis of media. (Might need to export directly from Whatsapp's mobile storage) and tie it up with `chat.txt`.
* A significant number of messages are _hindi_ words described in English. These cannot be analysed for sentiment (Although if this can be converted into devnagiri script, then it is easily possible)
