title: Debu the panda
---
I just got access to OpenAI's Dall·E after being on the waitlist since July!
I've seen examples, I've read about it, but there is nothing like playing with the app yourself!!

Last year I had experimented with their GPT-3, training a bot to imitate a [group chat with my friends](https://tejaswa.me/projects/gpt2Whatsapp.html). GPT3 however was a lot more technical; Dall·E is sooo simple.

What is it? Put simply, it's an AI that makes an image from a prompt. With GPT3 we could create life-like text, essays and stories from AI. Dall·E brings visual CREATION to the world of AI.

## I made a small story of Debu the panda going on vacation.
