As the first vice president for strategic development at the school's consulting club, my role was to raise our school's profile in consulting beyond the typical year-on-year recruiting processes. My team built the first interview insights guidebook for the intern class which covered 18 firms and practices. The raw data for this was obtained by interviewing over 60 alumni and students who'd been through the process, and might even be ont he other side now.

This page is about the strategic overviews we created for 12 industries that would help the clubâ€™s 250 members in casing and netowrking.
