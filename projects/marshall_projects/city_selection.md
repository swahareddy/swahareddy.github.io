date: 30 Jan 2023

This was a second round take-home assignment that I recieved for a corportae strategy internship. I was invited to the next round to talk about my approach, so I thought it's worth sharing. 

## Prompt: 

> It’s 2040, and Uber has been expanding its ride-sharing business, for 10 years. Uber is interested in converting some of its fleet into driverless cars in response to competitors. You’ve been asked to evaluate and recommend a city to pilot Uber’s driverless cars.
Please discuss how you would approach evaluating potential cities, as well as your recommendation of what city to pilot within. You can define what the case study is asking for in whatever way you like, but some potential areas to cover could include (but are not limited to):
> - Data internal to Uber that could inform recommendations
- External data that could inform recommendations and what resources to utilize
- Questions that would need to be answered to evaluate cities
- Specific types of analysis you would use to predict outcomes
- What data you would include in modeling and statistical analysis
- What quantitative and/or qualitative evidence you would want to include
> Write a short response (no more than 2 pages) summarizing your thought process and what city you would recommend piloting Uber’s driverless cars.

## My recommendation
