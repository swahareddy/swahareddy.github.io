title: Spotify Brand Strategy
---

As part of my elective on Branding Strategy, we (team of 5) did an in-depth analysis and recommendations for Spotify's branding strategy.

# Our Big Idea:

> At Spotify, we envision a future where our platform transcends its role as a mere audio streaming service
to become a vibrant and inclusive community, deeply connecting people through the power of music
and audio content. Our promise is to understand our users and their ever-evolving sentiments, enabling
them to forge deeper, more meaningful connections with others.
>
>With a focus on personalization, social interaction, and recognition of our most dedicated users, we
aim to transform Spotify into a dynamic and ever-engaging space that empowers our community to build relationships, share experiences, and fight feelings of loneliness through the universal language
of music.
>
>We will continually refresh the Spotify experience by partnering with cultural events, artists, and local
talents, creating a consistent and scalable sense of belonging, so that Spotify truly becomes the go-to
destination for people looking to connect, express themselves, and experience the world through the
magic of audio.
