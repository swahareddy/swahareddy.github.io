title: NVIDIA Stock Pitch (Generative AI)
date: 26 Jan 2023
---

USC Marshall has a $8 million Student Investment Fund where selct MBA students can understand how investors operate and how company's strategic decisions are perceived by markets. In the second year of my MBA, I will be working as fund manager in a team of 5 with full autonomy to take calculated positions with this fund. 

This is my presentation for why we should invest in NVIDIA stock. It was used as an initial screening criteria for fund managers. This was the first pitch I ever made, and made overnight. It's nowhere close to a fully reasoned recommendation, but rather a signal for my understanding of the concepts involved in investing.

> Peel the onion on the technological side of generative AI, and you’ll find NVIDIA supporting competitors like AWS, Azure across the world. As the commercial applications of this industry are developing, and chip competitors struggle with deep learning GPUs, NVIDIA is primed to
capture this market.
