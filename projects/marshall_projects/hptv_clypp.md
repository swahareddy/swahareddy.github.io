This video is part of an externship I did with [HP Tech Ventures](https://hptechventures.com/), the venture capital arm of HP Inc.

HP wants to grow its product portfolio for enterprise clients. HP already supports IaaS and VDaaS. These are meant to be application-layer solutions above those. My task was to explore pre-seed startups to present recommendations for due diligence and sourcing.

What I learned over these two months:
- Corporate VCs (Strategic buyers) vs regular VCs (financial buyers)
- The key deal selection paramters on which startups are evaluated
- Building TAMs. I built TAM models for five startups (each in a different space) which was really challenging since these were new markets with a lack of benchmarks and proxies.
