title: NVIDIA Stock Pitch (Generative AI)

> Peel the onion on the technological side of generative AI, and youâ€™ll find NVIDIA supporting competitors like AWS, Azure across the world. As the commercial applications of this industry are developing, and chip competitors struggle with deep learning GPUs, NVIDIA is primed to
capture this market.

This is my presentation for USC Marshall's $8 million Student Investment Fund on why they should invest in NVIDIA stock. It was used as a selection criteria for whether I should be a fund manager. This was my first pitch, made overnight, so it is nowhere close to a fully reasoned recommendation, but rather a signal for my understanding of the concepts involved in the role.
