# The problem
Imagine you are a recruiting manager at a big tech company, screening thousands of applications daily. When you finally filter them, you’ve to verify each candidate’s education, employment and certification history, to make sure it's all legitimate. The respective institutes need to be contacted to verify whether the information is correct, a process that takes weeks to complete.

More than 96% of employers conduct background checks to a certain degree during hiring processes. Of course there are background screening providers that recruiters often outsource the verification process to. But what if there is a reputable platform that already consists of 900 million global users. The time and cost saved by such a service could be incredibly beneficial to not only the employer, but the candidates as well.

We were a team of five across the MBA, business analytics, and marketing programs. My contribution was coming up with the concept, the stakeholder architecture, proposing a tech stack, and building the storyline.  

## UPDATE!
5 weeks after we made this presentation, LinkedIn announced the exact offering! Here are snippets form their press release:
- "Verify where you work with your company email or Microsoft Entra"
- "Verified ID is built on open standards for decentralized identity"
- "You’ll be able to display that your identity is verified on your LinkedIn profile, thanks to a US government-issued ID and US phone number"
