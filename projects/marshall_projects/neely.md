title: Advertising in Mixed Reality
---

Today marked the culmination of my fellowship at the Neely Center for Ethical Leadership and Decision Making. The Neely center explores the intersection of ethics and technology particularly in AI and social media. Our fellowship marked the center’s flagship extension into mixed reality (XR), and my topic was XR’s potential influence in advertising and buying decisions.

The idea of personalized advertising is nothing new, but it is limited to your screen time. XR glasses, in their ideal form-factor and sophistication can allow for hyper-personalization of our physical world. Subscriptions to see the world around you, AI-driven product placement, spatial computers inferring your preferences from your living room layout - these were some of the possible futures that I addressed.

This work was culmination of discussions with academics from policy and engineering, visits to startups working on technologies you wouldn’t believe exist, attending conferences around the country on retail, culture, and technology, and conversations with Prof Becker and the other fellows in the program.

Here's a recording and a copy of my presentation:
