        <h3>Why exactly is this?</h3>
    </header>
    <p>A hand drawn timeline of all major Indian events since the independence, covering 15th August 1947 -> 15th August 2020. It covers events across society, politics, technology, sports and religion</p>
    
    <header class="major">
        <h3>Why did I do this?</h3>
    </header>
    <p>As part of my voluntering effort with the NGO iTeach Schools, I conducted an extensive summer program for students. One of the programs that I organised was a recap of India's recent history</p>
    
    <header class="major">
        <h3>How did I do it?</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Me and my students used the links used <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timeline_of_Indian_history" class="card-link">Wikipedia</a> fo guidance followed by a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VaLkXPedR7Er_YgKqpUWGF1bJJmiliqjPdLRDJMil-c/edit?usp=sharing" class="card-link">4 session discussion and QnA</a> on these events. I then drew the noteworthy events using a digital pen in OneNote* on a SurfacePro.</p>

        <h3>Next steps</h3>
    </header>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding the relations between events. For instance, dotted lines between:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>J&K instrument of accession -> Abrogation of Article 370</li>
                <li>Dalai Lama exile -> 1962 War -> 1965 War</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Of course there are events missing in this overview, you can add^ further details. Eg - LAC conflict, Bhumi Pujan</li>
    </ul>
