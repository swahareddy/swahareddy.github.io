title: App-based Newspaper Delivery
---
I got excited about this one weekend and went around at 5am talking to distributors. After that, I came back and attempted some market sizing.

Some user research is needed, but I believe that its not just the older demographic, but even younger people who want a distraction free method of consuming news. The presentation does not cover some key features like flexibility of different newspapers (with supply being managed at an aggregate level). Add ons like magazines for the weekend, daily and vacation pauses. Digital twins for shareability, mobility. Partnerships with the publishers.

Ideal end state for this would be acquisition by a daily needs app (like BB daily, SuprDaily in India). These apps already have the in-person residential delivery process streamlined in the early hours of the day, making newspapers an ideal product to be paired with milk, bread etc that reaches your doorstep before you wake up.
