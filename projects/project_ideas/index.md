title: Some ideas of mine
---

I have a lot of project ideas that I note down, hoping to either read more and implement them or discard for being impractical. I am always looking for someone to collaborate with to make them happen. That's why I am making a note of some of them here. 

If any of these interest you and you want to bounce ideas (even without actually getting involved with code), please reach out to me.
