As part of our _Communication for Management_ class I had to pick a topic that interests me and present to an external audience. I focused on big-picture storytelling and trying to move the audience towards my new technology. The audience is supposed to be a room full of CTOs or other C suite execs from all industries (Travel, avaition, government, logistics, etc)

A large focus of this was was vocal, but I'm having trouble uploading the video. Here is the slide deck meanwhile:

This will be followed by a variation that is meant for internal stakeholders.
