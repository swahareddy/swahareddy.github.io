![folder structure](gifgenerator_images\folder_struct.gif)

1. We don't really need any specific file nomenclature. Only that each season's folder has alphabetical video files and alphabetical subtitle files.
2. Put all these season folders into one 'Sitcom Name' folder

![](gifgenerator_images/haevyouprep.gif)

I've use `.mp4` and `.srt` here, but they can be other formats too.

The first cell in `PrepDB.ipynb` simply reads the names of these files. The rest of this notebook reads individual subtitles, cleans them and then streams them into BigQuery line-by-line.

3 episodes in the GIF above were about 45,000 rows/subtitles.

# Ask for the GIF
>`MakeGIF.ipynb`
1. Just set the variable name `selected_dialogue` as the word/dialog you want to search for.
2. You will be asked which dialog you want to base your GIF on.
![dialog options](gifgenerator_images\dialog_options.jpg)

3. Based on your selection and its corresponding timestamps, a video is cut, the text is overlayed and the gif is saved.

# Ask for it on your mobile! ðŸ“²

Check out `jeevz.py` where I made a chat bot to ask for GIFs!

![chat bot screenshot](gifgenerator_images\jeevz_chat_bot.jpeg)

I used [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nhdxpoicW4) and [this](https://pypi.org/project/telegram-send/) to make the chatbot. You should probably write your own, mine breaks easily.

## Future Scope
These are easy enough to offer:
* You can make a GIF that includes subtitles adjacent to each other too
* Subtitles are sometimes a few seconds out of sync. Offer a simple +/- 3 seconds option for the video
* Edit the subtitle to a custom text?

--> Also, in BigQuery, implement a UDF for Levenshtein distance/ Cosine similarity so that the user need not remember it word for word


### Making this accessible for all
Any cloud based solution will basically need episodes available online to be downloaded ino an execution env
* Upload the seasons to GCS/ YouTube (Unlisted)
* Turn this into a Colab notebook (thus avoiding data cost/time in downloading the whole episode from where GIF is to be picked)
* Maybe even break each episode into small Â¬5MB chunks and upload so that user running notebook locally does not have large UL/DL cost.
